<h1>Friends</h1>
<p>Here is a picture of me and my friends at senior prom. I have been friends with most of these people all throughout high school and some of them since middle school. We enjoy hanging out and listening to music, driving around, playing pickup basketball, and doing anything else we can find. I hope to remain friends with them for as long as possible.</p>
