<h1>Me and my interests</h1>

<p>I would consider myself a shy type of person at first but if I get to know people I can crack out of that shell. I am a very laid back kind of person and mostly like to hangout out a lot but not all the time. My interests mainly consist of music, sports, friends, and food. I will pretty much eat most foods but Italian is my favorite. I also love to play various sports but I am a huge Boston sports fan, mainly the Patriots and Celtics. My favorite music varies many genres including rap, hip hop, classic rock, and many others. My favorite artist right now is rapper Travis Scott.</p>
